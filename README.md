This folder contains codes employed for results contained in arXiv:2010.05853, specifically, for obtaining various types of bounds on violation of generalized noncontextual inequalities, featuring first implementations of sdp hierarchies based on a novel unitary operator parametrisation.  

If you use these codes, or some derivatives of the same, please cite arXiv:2010.05853.
