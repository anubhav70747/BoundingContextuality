This folder contains methods for evaluating bounds on generalized noncontextual inequalities featured in  (PORAC/MPORAC) (Octave/Matlab + Yalmip + sdpt3/sedumi/mosek):

- **nonconIneqOC.m**: LP for evaluating bounds pertaining to contextual polytope for oblivious communication games. 
- **nonconIneqPiQ1.m**: level = 1 NPA-like SDP with projectors. 
- **nonconIneqUQ1.m**: level = 1 NPA-like SDP with unitaries. 
- **nonconIneqPiQ2.m**: level = 2 NPA-like SDP with projectors. 
- **nonconIneqUQ2_beta.m**: level = 2 NPA-like SDP with unitaries.
- **nonconIneqQ.m**: See-Saw SDP.
- **SuccNC.m**: An auxiliary function for nonconIneqQ.m for calculating success probability given tasks parameters, states and measurements.
